# Husqvarnaâ€™s homepage :motorcycle:
Company Home Page with Flexbox (Codecademy) :robot:

## Introduction

This is the Husqvarna motorcycle homepage made by myself.  This project is given by codecademy in the Full Stack Engineer path course, but for the first time I did not follow a series of steps to do it. The project is mainly for practicing flexbox so it is not yet adaptable to a small screen. 

Soon I will make it responsive and I will put a photo of myself as the president of the company :joy: Hope the Husqvarna guys don't mind, I just want to own a motorcycle and learn how to make cool pages :sunglasses:
